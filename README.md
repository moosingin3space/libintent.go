This project is the reference implementation of my Universal Intents
specification. It is implemented in the Go programming language for
convenience -- a C version will be implemented in my project
[libintent](https://github.com/moosingin3space/libintent).

The compliance suite will be implemented at a later date and will be used to
verify the functionality of both `libintent` and `libintent.go`.
